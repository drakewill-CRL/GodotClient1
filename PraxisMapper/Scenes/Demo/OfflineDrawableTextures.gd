#See the offlineDrawableDemo file? This is going to do that, but with actual drawn images instead.
#ideally, a bunch of smaller textures will operate better than one huge node with a ton of draw commands.
#Which does require drawing those maptiles first. Maybe I should get that node set up to display
#progress on-screen first.

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	pass # Replace with function body.


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
